## Security by Design

Red Magic Room is designed with privacy and security in mind:

- **No network access**: The app makes zero network requests
- **No data collection**: No analytics, telemetry, or tracking
- **Local storage only**: Settings stored in local UserDefaults
- **No external dependencies**: Built entirely with Apple frameworks
- **Sandboxed**: Runs in macOS App Sandbox

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please:

1. **Do not** open a public issue
2. Email the maintainer directly or use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
3. Include steps to reproduce the issue
4. Allow reasonable time for a fix before public disclosure

We take security seriously and will respond promptly to verified reports.
